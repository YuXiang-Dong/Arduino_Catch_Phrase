# Arduino_Catch_Phrase
## Description:
The goal of this project is to re-make, and effectively redesign, the 2nd project we did this year: Catch_phrase.  
Since microcontrollers are much more powerful and functional than AOI logic gates your design should be much more efficient -
and take you a fraction of the time to completely duplicate it using an Arduino!

Play my catch phrase project [here](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/41oGFU3P3qg-project2-remake/editel)

## Hardware Requirements (optional - only if you already have them!):
one Arduino <br>
one 7 Segment Display <br>
seven 220-ohm Resistors

## Project Functional Requirements:
Phase 1: Design the circuit and complete the coding on Tinkercad to duplicate the functional circuit you submitted for Project #2.  All the requirements are the same as project #2 in terms of displaying your output.

There are many ways to accomplish this, choose the method that your prefer (be efficient where possible)
